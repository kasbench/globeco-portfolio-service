# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a new bulk portfolio posting endpoint to the API v2 that allows clients to submit up to 100 portfolios in a single request. The endpoint will accept a list of PortfolioPostDTO objects and return a list of PortfolioResponseDTO objects. All portfolios will be processed as a single batch transaction - either all succeed or all fail. The feature includes retry logic with exponential backoff for recoverable database errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to post multiple portfolios in a single request, so that I can efficiently bulk-load portfolio data without making individual API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to /api/v2/portfolios with a list of PortfolioPostDTO objects THEN the system SHALL accept up to 100 portfolios in the request
2. WHEN the request contains more than 100 portfolios THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
3. WHEN the request contains an empty list THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN all portfolios in the batch are valid THEN the system SHALL process them as a single database transaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want all portfolios in my batch request to succeed or fail together, so that I can handle partial failures appropriately in my application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any portfolio in the batch fails validation THEN the system SHALL reject the entire batch and return validation errors
2. WHEN the database transaction fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and no portfolios SHALL be persisted
3. WHEN all portfolios are successfully persisted THEN the system SHALL return a list of PortfolioResponseDTO objects corresponding to each input portfolio

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bulk posting feature to handle transient database errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't cause data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recoverable database error occurs THEN the system SHALL retry the operation up to 3 times
2. WHEN retrying after a failure THEN the system SHALL use exponential backoff with delays of 1s, 2s, and 4s
3. WHEN all retry attempts are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
4. WHEN a non-recoverable error occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT retry and return an error immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API client, I want consistent error handling between v1 and v2 endpoints, so that I can reuse my existing error handling logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return the same ValidationError DTO format as v1 or an equivalent new format
2. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes consistent with v1 behavior
3. WHEN the request is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the v2 bulk endpoint to maintain API consistency with v1, so that the interface is predictable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bulk operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 201 Created status
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request status
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 Internal Server Error status
4. WHEN the request payload exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 413 Payload Too Large status
