# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GlobeCo Portfolio Service currently suffers from extreme performance overhead due to excessive monitoring, tracing, and middleware layers. A simple CRUD service for portfolio management should not require 5+ seconds to create 10 records. This specification outlines the requirements to streamline the service while maintaining essential functionality and observability, with a unified OpenTelemetry-only monitoring approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer using the portfolio service, I want bulk operations to complete in under 200ms for 10 portfolios, so that the service can handle realistic workloads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating 10 portfolios via bulk API THEN the system SHALL complete the operation in less than 200ms
2. WHEN performing individual portfolio operations THEN the system SHALL respond in less than 50ms
3. WHEN the service is under normal load THEN memory usage SHALL remain below 256MB per pod
4. WHEN the service is under normal load THEN CPU usage SHALL remain below 200m per pod

### Requirement 2: Monitoring Rationalization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a single, unified monitoring solution using only OpenTelemetry, so that I can reduce complexity and overhead while maintaining essential observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL use only OpenTelemetry OTLP metrics
2. WHEN in production environment THEN Prometheus metrics collection SHALL be disabled
3. WHEN exporting metrics THEN the system SHALL send OTLP metrics to the OpenTelemetry collector via hostport routing
4. WHEN monitoring is configured THEN the system SHALL support tiered observability (development vs production)
5. WHEN high-volume operations occur THEN the system SHALL implement sampling for traces and metrics

### Requirement 3: Middleware Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want middleware to be conditionally loaded based on environment, so that production deployments have minimal overhead while development retains full observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production environment THEN EnhancedHTTPMetricsMiddleware SHALL be disabled
2. WHEN running in production environment THEN thread monitoring middleware SHALL be disabled
3. WHEN running in development environment THEN full middleware stack SHALL be available
4. WHEN middleware is loaded THEN it SHALL be configurable via environment variables
5. WHEN processing requests THEN essential middleware (CORS, security) SHALL always be active

### Requirement 4: Database Operation Optimization

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want database operations to have minimal tracing overhead, so that the service can achieve optimal performance in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in production environment THEN database operation tracing SHALL be disabled by default
2. WHEN database tracing is disabled THEN operations SHALL execute without span creation overhead
3. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use optimized `insert_many` operations
4. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use optimized connection pooling
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement simplified retry logic with circuit breaker pattern

### Requirement 5: Logging Optimization

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want structured, environment-appropriate logging, so that I can debug issues without performance impact in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in production environment THEN log level SHALL be set to WARNING or higher
2. WHEN logging is active THEN the system SHALL use structured logging with correlation IDs
3. WHEN processing bulk operations THEN verbose request/response logging SHALL be disabled in production
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log essential error information without full payloads
5. WHEN in development environment THEN full debug logging SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want environment-based configuration profiles, so that I can optimize settings for each deployment environment without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL support development/staging/production profiles
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN monitoring features SHALL be configurable at runtime
3. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL use performance-optimized defaults
4. WHEN features are configured THEN the system SHALL support feature flags for observability components
5. WHEN resources are allocated THEN the system SHALL use right-sized limits and requests per environment

### Requirement 7: Service Layer Simplification

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a simplified service layer with minimal abstractions, so that the code is maintainable and performs optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary abstraction layers
2. WHEN performing database operations THEN the service SHALL use direct database operations where appropriate
3. WHEN handling bulk operations THEN the system SHALL implement fast-path processing
4. WHEN validating input THEN the system SHALL use cached validation for performance
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL maintain testability through dependency injection

### Requirement 8: Container and Deployment Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want optimized container images and Kubernetes configurations, so that the service uses minimal resources and scales efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building container images THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage builds for production
2. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN resource requests and limits SHALL be right-sized per environment
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory
4. WHEN health checks are performed THEN probes SHALL be optimized for fast startup and reliable health detection
5. WHEN updating deployments THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime rolling updates

### Requirement 9: API Compatibility and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want all existing API contracts to be maintained during optimization, so that my applications continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN APIs are optimized THEN all existing API contracts SHALL be maintained
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP status codes and error responses
3. WHEN handling failures THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation
4. WHEN external dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL use circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate request/response compression

### Requirement 10: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want essential observability without performance overhead, so that I can monitor system health while maintaining optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
2. WHEN exporting telemetry THEN the system SHALL use async/background processing
3. WHEN tracing is enabled THEN the system SHALL implement configurable sampling (1-10% of requests)
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL focus on essential health and performance indicators
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support on-demand detailed logging and tracing
