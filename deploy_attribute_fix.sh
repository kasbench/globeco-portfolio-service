echo "1. Changed attribute names to match FastAPI instrumentation:"
echo "   - method -> http_method"
echo "   - path -> http_target" 
echo "   - status -> http_status_code"
echo "2. Removed service_name attribute (comes from resource)"
echo "3. Simplified in-flight gauge attributes"

echo "üîç To verify the fix:"
echo "1. Wait 10-15 seconds for metrics export"
echo "2. Check collector: curl \"http://localhost:8889/metrics\" | grep \"app\\.monitoring\""
echo "3. Look for custom metrics with http_method, http_target attributes"
