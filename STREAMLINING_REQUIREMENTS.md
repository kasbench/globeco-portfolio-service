# Portfolio Service Streamlining Requirements

## Executive Summary

The GlobeCo Portfolio Service currently suffers from extreme performance overhead due to excessive monitoring, tracing, and middleware layers. A simple CRUD service for portfolio management should not require 5+ seconds to create 10 records. This document outlines requirements to streamline the service while maintaining essential functionality and observability.

## Current State Analysis

### Performance Issues
- **Bulk operations**: 5000ms for 10 portfolios (should be <100ms)
- **Individual operations**: Likely also impacted by overhead
- **Resource consumption**: Excessive CPU/memory usage for simple operations

### Root Causes
1. **Over-instrumentation**: Every database call wrapped in OpenTelemetry spans
2. **Redundant monitoring**: Both Prometheus and OpenTelemetry metrics.  Remove the Prometheus metrics.
3. **Complex middleware stack**: Multiple layers processing each request
4. **Verbose logging**: Excessive debug information for production
5. **Heavy thread monitoring**: Real-time thread enumeration and analysis
6. **Network overhead**: Multiple export attempts to monitoring endpoints
