# Final Fix Summary

## Key Changes Made

Based on the working `globeco-security-service` example, I've made these critical changes:

### 1. Fixed Attribute Names
**Changed from:**
```python
otel_attributes = {
    "http.method": method,
    "http.route": path, 
    "http.status_code": status,
    "service.namespace": settings.service_namespace,
    "service.name": "globeco-portfolio-service"
}
```

**Changed to (matching working service):**
```python
otel_attributes = {
    "method": method,
    "path": path,
    "status": status,
    "service_name": "globeco-portfolio-service"
}
```

### 2. Fixed Meter Scope Name
**Changed from:**
```python
meter = metrics.get_meter(__name__)  # Would be "app.monitoring"
```

**Changed to:**
```python
meter = metrics.get_meter("app.monitoring")  # Explicit scope name
```

### 3. Simplified All Metric Attributes
- **In-flight metrics**: Only `service_name`
- **Thread metrics**: Only `service_name` 
- **Queue metrics**: Only `service_name`

## Expected Results

After deployment, your metrics should appear in Prometheus exactly like the working service:

```
http_request_duration_milliseconds_count{
    method="GET",
    path="/api/v1/portfolio/{id}",
    status="200",
    service_name="globeco-portfolio-service",
    k8s_deployment_name="globeco-portfolio-service",
    k8s_namespace_name="globeco",
    ...
}
```

## Key Insights

1. **Attribute naming matters**: Must match exactly what other working services use
2. **Meter scope name**: Should be consistent with your app structure
3. **Simplicity**: Don't over-complicate attributes - the k8sattributes processor adds the k8s.* labels
4. **Service identification**: Use `service_name` not `service.name` or `service_namespace`

## Why This Should Work

The working service shows the exact format that successfully flows through your collector to Prometheus. By matching that format exactly, your custom metrics should now appear alongside the standard metrics.

The collector will add all the k8s.* attributes automatically via the k8sattributes processor, so you only need to provide the core metric attributes.
