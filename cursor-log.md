Prompt: Please execute step 1 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Reviewed documentation/requirements.mdc for MongoDB connection details (host, port, database, no auth).
2. Confirmed no existing MongoDB configuration or connection code in the app/ directory.
3. Created app/config.py with pydantic-settings for MongoDB URI and database name, defaulting to the required values.
4. Updated app/main.py to initialize Beanie with the MongoDB connection on startup, using the new config.


Prompt: Please execute step 2 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Reviewed requirements and pyproject.toml to confirm pytest, pytest-asyncio, and testcontainers[mongodb] are included as dependencies.
2. Created tests/conftest.py with a pytest fixture that starts a MongoDB test container using testcontainers, and sets the MONGODB_URI environment variable for tests.
3. Updated app/config.py to allow the MongoDB URI to be overridden by the MONGODB_URI environment variable, enabling tests to use the test container instance.


Prompt: Please execute step 3 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Reviewed requirements.mdc and requirements-rules.mdc for Portfolio schema, DTOs, and API specifications.
2. Created app/models.py with the Beanie Document for Portfolio, including all required fields and constraints.
3. Created app/schemas.py with Pydantic DTOs: PortfolioResponseDTO, PortfolioPutDTO, PortfolioPostDTO, following naming and field conventions.
4. Implemented app/api.py with FastAPI CRUD endpoints for Portfolio, including optimistic concurrency on update and delete.
5. Updated app/main.py to register the Portfolio model with Beanie and include the new API router so endpoints are available.


Prompt: Please execute step 4 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Reviewed the Portfolio API implementation and requirements for test coverage.
2. Created tests/test_portfolio.py with async Pytest tests for all Portfolio CRUD operations using httpx.AsyncClient and the MongoDB test container fixture.
3. Tests cover create, read (all/one), update (success and version conflict), delete (success and version conflict), and not-found cases, ensuring full coverage and optimistic concurrency control.


Prompt: Please execute step 5 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Checked the project root for an existing Dockerfile and confirmed none was present.
2. Created a Dockerfile for the FastAPI/Beanie/MongoDB app using Python 3.13-slim, installing dependencies with uv, exposing port 8000, and using Uvicorn as the entrypoint, following best practices for production images.

2024-06-10: User requested OpenTelemetry instrumentation for the project, with Prometheus as the OTEL backend. Metrics and traces are sent to otel-collector.monitor.svc.cluster.local:4317 (gRPC) and otel-collector.monitor.svc.cluster.local:4318 (HTTP). Installed OpenTelemetry and Prometheus client packages (excluding unavailable Beanie/Motor instrumentations). Updated app/main.py to:
- Set up OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics with both gRPC and HTTP OTLP exporters
- Instrument FastAPI, HTTPX, and logging
- Add a /metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping

2024-06-10: Created k8s manifests for deployment. Added k8s/globeco-portfolio-service.yaml for the FastAPI app (globeco-portfolio-service, port 8000, with probes and resource limits) and k8s/globeco-portfolio-service-mongodb.yaml for MongoDB as a StatefulSet (globeco-portfolio-service-mongodb, port 27017, 1 node, persistent storage). Both are in the globeco namespace.
