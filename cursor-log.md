Prompt: Please execute step 1 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Reviewed documentation/requirements.mdc for MongoDB connection details (host, port, database, no auth).
2. Confirmed no existing MongoDB configuration or connection code in the app/ directory.
3. Created app/config.py with pydantic-settings for MongoDB URI and database name, defaulting to the required values.
4. Updated app/main.py to initialize Beanie with the MongoDB connection on startup, using the new config.


Prompt: Please execute step 2 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Reviewed requirements and pyproject.toml to confirm pytest, pytest-asyncio, and testcontainers[mongodb] are included as dependencies.
2. Created tests/conftest.py with a pytest fixture that starts a MongoDB test container using testcontainers, and sets the MONGODB_URI environment variable for tests.
3. Updated app/config.py to allow the MongoDB URI to be overridden by the MONGODB_URI environment variable, enabling tests to use the test container instance.


Prompt: Please execute step 3 of @execution-plan.mdc
Actions:
1. Reviewed requirements.mdc and requirements-rules.mdc for Portfolio schema, DTOs, and API specifications.
2. Created app/models.py with the Beanie Document for Portfolio, including all required fields and constraints.
3. Created app/schemas.py with Pydantic DTOs: PortfolioResponseDTO, PortfolioPutDTO, PortfolioPostDTO, following naming and field conventions.
4. Implemented app/api.py with FastAPI CRUD endpoints for Portfolio, including optimistic concurrency on update and delete.
5. Updated app/main.py to register the Portfolio model with Beanie and include the new API router so endpoints are available.
